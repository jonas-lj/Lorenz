# Lorenz

This code was used for composing "Lorenz-6674089274190705457 (Seltsamer Attraktor)" by Morten Bach & Jonas Lindstr√∏m from the album [pieces of infinity 01](https://promo.theorchard.com/0VNkK7jSZSr7CQNGq4Ny?fbclid=IwAR396l5asHEt6SK-2kbKJ5-bzyQGoTGuIGytP26PBcd9UwPyqJs48Lf92Zg). It computes curves in a [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) and maps a subset of the points to musical notes according to a prespecified rule. The resulting tracks are saved as MIDI files.

The program may be built and run using Maven by executing `mvn install` to build and then `mvn exec_java`to run. This will create three MIDI files in the project directory. The parameters used to compute the curve and the tracks are defined in lorenz.properties and are the ones used on the actual recording, but they may be changed to produce other results.

The MOSEF library is included as a submodule since this code depends on it. You may also clone it directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/jonas-lj/MOSEF).
